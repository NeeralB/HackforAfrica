            <p class = "blog-body">My family has planted some Maize crops this summer. They have just started to sprout and grow. One tip that helped us grow maize was soaking the seeds in water before planting. We can’t wait to harvest these plants!</p>

            <p class = "blog-body">We are planting mangrove saplings and seeds to help save the mangrove forest from disappearing. These plants grow well in tropical and subtropical areas, which is perfect because the Kenyan coast is tropical. I’m so proud of our team for coming together to do this. One of our members, Roy, even offered to take a break from his job as a fisherman to help us plant these seeds!f</p>

            <p class = "blog-body">The women in our community are hard at work sowing okra in our zai pits. We put the seeds in a open area that reaches sun, since okras need around 8 hours of sunlight a day. We are using a technique to put manure in our zai pits to collect water and feed our plants. So far, this has been working great.</p>
